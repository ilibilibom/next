# Theme for headless WordPress by redandblue

This theme removes everything visible from the WordPress and sets up
some good practices and conventions for the REST API, and overall as well.

## Getting started

Add the following lines to your `composer.json`

Under 'repositories', add:

```json
{
  "type": "git",
  "url": "https://github.com/redandbluefi/wp-headless-theme.git"
}
```

Under 'require', add:

```json
  "redandbluefi/wp-headless-theme": "dev-master",
```

> Note: Currently requires ACF to REST plugin

> Should work with Polylang
